This repository is an official repository for CSMI M2 project with CADLM.

The subject of the project is "Image Recognition".

At the moment of creation of this description project includes:

 - bibliographic study of methods and algorithms used in the domain;
 - study of applications and areas of application of the subject;
 
With the course of time, according to advancement in the research on the topic, 
the final plan of the project covers the following aspects:

 - bibliographic study of methods and algorithms used in the domain;
 - study of applications and areas of application of the subject;
 - reveiew of the mathematical background of CNN and wavelet theory;
 - study of possible application of wavelet transform, coupled with different kinds of CNN in image recognition, namely for classification and detection problems;

The structure of repository is as follows:

 * doc :: Contains bibliographic  sources, reports and other text files;
 * src :: Contains source code, notebooks or any other programming-related files.
 
 As image processing usually needs a lot of computational capacity, especially with a powerful GPU, the practical side of the study was conducted in the Google Colaboratory. One may access the shared folder via the following link:

Two datasets were used in the study:

 - Intel image classification;
 - understanding cloud formations;
 
 Both of them are taken from Kaggle.

Additional pieces of information will be added with the development of the project.
